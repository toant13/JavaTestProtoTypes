Brief Overview of Design

The server sent event design(Pulling Model) consists of two REST calls on the server side REST interface. The first method is POST call that creates a runnable object and executes it and the second method is a GET call that returns that status of the process executed. 

--POST call--
When the client hits the POST call, a process is created and then executed.  The process ID is wrapped up with a URI and returned to the client.  The client can then use that URI to monitor the status of the executed process.

--GET call--
When the process is executed, the server sends back updates to the client.  After the process is complete, there are no more events sent back to the client
